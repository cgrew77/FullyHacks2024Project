**Description:**

Neon Nonsense (and Whatnot) is a survival game meant to replicate the popular game Vampire Survivors, with many of the same mechanics. The player is able to move with WASD and shoot enemies with the Left Mouse Button. Enemies drop experience coins that allow the player to level up and upgrade their stats, such as speed, damage, and fire rate.

The enemy spawns are fully customizable, letting the user choose enemy type, spawn start and end times, amounts, and frequencies for a unique experience every time.

The game is also expandable, with the room for more upgradeable stats, and an infinite playstyle with the possibility of a score timer and leaderboard.

**Software used:**

Godot Engine v4.2.1
